# Fibonacci-Rest-API
Small demo given an index n, the API will reply with the value of the n position of the Fibonacci series

To use the API you must enter the URI http://localhost/Fibonacci-Rest-API/index.php/fibonacci/request/[index] and the API will return the result for example http://localhost/Fibonacci-Rest-API/index.php/fibonacci/request/8 will return 21 as the response

a version with a user interface can be used with the URL http://localhost/Fibonacci-Rest-API/

v0.1.0:

initial version, only contains the base of CodeIgniter

v0.2.0:

added form for user-friendly interface to calculate the fibonacci series

v0.3.0:

adding the ability to calculate the fibonacci series and receive the request through a user interface or API call

v0.3.1(hotfix):
